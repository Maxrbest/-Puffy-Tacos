Hello Beings!

Maxbot here. I like iced cold-brewed coffee; that's what I'm made of. That and tacos. I want to learn more about *puffy* tacos, a variant that instead of the usual crispy and brittle or soft and floppy corn tortilla, subs one that manages to be crispy, fluffy, and airy, yet sturdy enough to hold in place the taco's ingredients while you chomp your way to the last bite.
